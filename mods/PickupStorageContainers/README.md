# Pickup Storage Containers ### How to Use

1. **Place storage containers on your base** within your Land Claim Block area
2. **Hold 'E' key** while looking at any supported storage container (2-3 seconds)
3. **Select "Pickup"** from the radial interaction menu
4. The container will be returned to your inventory with all contents preserved

## Requirements

- **Land Claim Block ownership**: You must own the LCB in the area where the container is placed
- **Area coverage**: Storage containers must be within your LCB protected area
- **Container access**: You must have access to the container (not locked by another player)
- **Hold interaction**: You need to hold 'E' for 2-3 seconds to see the pickup option

## Technical Details

The mod adds two essential properties to each supported container:
- **`CanPickup="true"`**: Enables the pickup functionality
- **`TakeDelay="2-3"`**: Sets the hold time required (2 seconds for crates/cabinets, 3 seconds for safes/fridges)

These work together with the game's Land Claim Block system to provide secure pickup functionality.scription

This mod allows players to pickup all storage containers, chests, safes, and other storage blocks on their base. The pickup feature works only within the Land Claim Block (LCB) area and requires ownership of the LCB.
